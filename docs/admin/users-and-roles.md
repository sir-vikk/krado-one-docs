# Users, roles, and permissions

DevX uses role-based access control (RBAC). Every user has a role that defines which portals they can access and what they can do inside each one.

**Configure in:** Portal Config → Users / Roles & Permissions

---

## Built-in roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **admin** | Full access to all portals and Portal Config |
| **developer** | Access to Task, DRM, DevX, Runbook, and Platform portals (read + write) |
| **viewer** | Read-only access to portals they are granted access to |

Built-in roles cannot be deleted but their descriptions can be edited.
